# Part 1: User Profile Setup  
## Create a User Profile Component:  
  
- Name your component UserProfile. It should display a user's name, biography, and a list of hobbies. This information will be passed as props to the component.

## Implement Conditional Rendering:  
  
- Within the UserProfile component, use conditional rendering to display a message if the user's biography is not provided. For example, "No biography available".

# Part 2: Dynamic Hobbies List  
## Rendering the Hobbies List:  
  
- Pass a list of hobbies to the UserProfile component as props. Use the map function to display each hobby as an item in an unordered list.
- If the list of hobbies is empty, display a message like "No hobbies listed".

# Part 3: Navigation and Page Layout  
## Implement Client-Side Navigation:  
  
- Create a simple navigation bar component that allows the user to navigate between the 'Home' page and the 'User Profile' page without reloading the page. Use the Link component from Next.js for navigation links.

## Create a Home Page and Profile Page:  
  
- Set up two pages in your Next.js app folder: page.js (Home) and profile directory (page.js).
- Include the navigation bar in both pages to allow easy navigation between them.

# Part 4: Fetching User Data  
## Simulate Fetching User Data:  
- On the 'User Profile' page, simulate fetching user data (e.g., name, biography, hobbies) by defining a user object and passing it as props to the UserProfile component.
